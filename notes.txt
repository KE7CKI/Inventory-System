weigh the colors for part qty:
	color code the quantity to the number of batches we can build
	if we need 3 of a part, we should color code the part red
	
	example:
		3 handles for a G2 build, build batches in sets of 9
		9*3   = 27;	red
		2*9*3 = 54;	orange
		3*9*3 = 81;	yellow
		anything > 81;  grey/white

Assemblies databases
	A single table containing names of all assemblies assemblies_master_list

	A table for each assembly (by the name in assemblies_master_list) that contains each part and
the quantity required of that part

Assemblies tab
	a list of all assemblies (using the assemblies_master_list)
	
	create an assembly (adds name to assemblies_master_list)
	
	view and edit an assembly (create a table for assembly and add parts to it)


The Databases
	
	the assemblies database
		'id' is the id of the completed assembly
		'number' is the assembly number of the completed assembly -
the number used as the title of the table containing the parts
		'description' is the description of the part
		'count' is the number of assemblies we have in stock
		'shelf' is the shelf location
		'bin' is the bin location

	after we insert the assembly into the master list, we need to create a
table containing all the parts using the following statement:	

	CREATE TABLE `AST0001` (`id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `partId` INT(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

	'AST0001' is ASsemblies Test 0001
	'id' is the id of the assembly
	'partId' is the id of the part found in the master_list
